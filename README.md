# Big-Mart-Sales-Prediction
This project is a data-driven analytical study designed to extract meaningful insights from a structured dataset through rigorous statistical analysis and computational methodologies. The objective is to process raw data, identify significant patterns, and derive actionable conclusions using advanced data science techniques.
The workflow includes systematic data preprocessing to handle missing values, outlier detection, and feature engineering for optimal performance. An extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase is incorporated, utilizing visual and statistical methods to uncover trends and correlations. Furthermore, predictive modeling and hypothesis testing are employed to validate key assumptions and generate accurate forecasts.

Leveraging industry-standard libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn, this project ensures high efficiency and reproducibility. The final deliverables include well-documented scripts, dynamic visualizations, and a structured report presenting key findings, recommendations, and future improvement strategies. The codebase is designed to be modular, scalable, and adaptable for further enhancements and extended applications in real-world scenarios.
